When using the commander feature of the application, you may connect to different services: Frontier, EDSM or Inara.

## Frontier Authentication

When Frontier authentication is used this application inevitably receives:
- Frontier ID: your unique ID for this system
- Name: the real name specified in your account
- Email: the email address associated with your account
- Platform: whether this is a Frontier account, XBox, Playstation or Steam. The 'Authorized Applications' lists all the Clients (applications) you've authorised to request data on your behalf.

The application does not process, transmit elsewhere, or store any of this information. They are transmitted to EDCompanion due to the design of the login system.
Only a login token and your commander name are stored locally on your device and are only transmitted when calling the Frontier API to fetch your commander informations.

## EDSM

- Your commander name on EDSM
- Your EDSM API key
These informations are stored locally on your device and are only transmitted when calling the EDSM API to fetch your commander informations.

## Inara

When Inara authentication is used the application needs to store :
- Your Inara API key
This API key is stored locally on your device and is only transmitted when calling the Inara API to fetch your commander informations.
